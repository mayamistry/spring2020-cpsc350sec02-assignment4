Note: mayamistry is the only person who pushed it to github since Jessie sent me her code and we coded most of it together over zoom meetings.

NOTE: Our simulation is all empty at time 0 but everything starts at time 1, so our statistics might be a a unit or two off from the stats that you compare our assignment with (double checked with Professor German and said that it should be okay if it is a little off)
